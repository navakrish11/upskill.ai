2. **API Routing**: API calls are proxied to Express server at `/api/*` routes
3. **Data Processing**: Server processes requests using storage interface
4. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM handles PostgreSQL interactions
5. **Response**: JSON responses are returned with proper error handling
6. **Client State**: TanStack Query manages caching and synchronization
